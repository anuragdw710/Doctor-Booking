<h4>Developed a MERN Stack Doctor Appointment Booking App</h4>
<br/>
<h6>
 I had the opportunity to lead the development of a dynamic Doctor Appointment Booking App using the MERN Stack, which allowed me to demonstrate my expertise in full-stack application development. In order to ensure efficient and effective operation, I designed and implemented complex MongoDB queries, schemas, and models to support the application's various functionalities.

As part of my role, I developed intuitive User Interfaces tailored to the specific needs of Users, Admins, and Doctors, while also integrating robust security features such as JWT Authentication and Password Hashing. To enhance the user experience, I leveraged the Ant Design Library to create visually appealing and user-friendly UI Components.

To streamline data management, I employed Redux Toolkit for state management, and implemented Notifications Functionality for all users of the application. In addition, I developed a comprehensive Admin panel to facilitate easy management of Users, Doctors, and Appointments, ultimately leading to an efficient and user-friendly application.
